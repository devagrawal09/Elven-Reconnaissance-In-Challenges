      'Habit City has been filled with rumours about a treasure being hidden somewhere in the big tomato garden. When there is a call for volunteers to help harvest, you decide to take the chance to go and have a look for yourself - maybe you\'ll find the treasure whilst harvesting!\n\n**What is a tomato/pom/pomodoro?**  \nA pom is defined as 25 mins of work followed by at least 5 mins of break. There must be a break for it to count.\n\n**The Rules**  \nThe challenge runs for 24 hours from midnight to midnight of the selected day. Each hour represents one patch of field harvested/searched for treasure.   \nDo poms. You are free to do as many or as few poms as you like during the course of the challenge, meaning during the selected day.  \nThere is one to-do for each hour of the day. Enter in the notes of the to-do how many poms you did in that hour, in plain numbers. **You must enter sth into the notes to be eligible to win for that time slot.**  \nIf the top of an hour happens during a pom, enter the pom for the hour that most of it was done in. Example: You start a pom at 1.52pm. Enter it for the 2-3pm slot.  \nYou may check off to-dos for time slots where you did not do any poms, leaving the notes empty.\n\n**Winner**  \nAt the end of the challenge, an hour will be selected by RNG. Everybody who did a pom during this hour has a chance to win - if several people "searched this patch of field", a winner will be selected by RNG from among them.\n\nIf a time slot is selected during which no poms were done, the challenge will be ended without a winner, and the gem prize will be added to the prize of a new challenge, until a winner was found.',

      '*If you\'re new, read the "How to use this challenge" and "How to win" sections below*\n\n## Story episode\nYou\'ve had a long day. In a city several days\' journey from home, you and a large group of rogues have succeeded in selling stolen wares for much gold, and have acquired some new treasures besides. You don\'t doubt that the city officials, at the complaints of the wealthy personages you\'ve robbed, will realize a large operation has been at work in the city, and will soon be searching for the whereabouts of your group and of the stolen goods. You split again into several parties, quickly moving to different exits out of the city before the gates close for the night. You\'ll be travelling back to Habit City in small groups, and by different routes, so as not to draw attention. You and two others form a small band, disguising yourselves as poor vagabonds. As the afternoon sun wanes, you shoulder a very heavy backpack and shuffle into the streets, making your way close to a market square by the western gate.\n\n## How to use this challenge\n\n1. **Choose your goal(s)**\nEdit the "Physical activities" to-do to create a checklist of the physical activities you want to accomplish this week (this checklist won\'t be seen by others). If you\'re not sure where to start, why not ask in the [The Rogues\' Playground](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02330380-adcc-4e6b-b208-127de8cc70b9) guild chat. Let\'s say you want to do yoga two times, you could list "Yoga #1" and "Yoga #2" in the checklist. Or you could list days of the week with tasks, such as "Monday: 20 minutes of yoga", "Thursday: 30 minutes of yoga".\n2. **When you accomplish each activity, check it off in the checklist.**\n3. **Check off the "Physical activities" to-do.**\nWhen you\'re ready (either when you\'ve completed all your activities or just when you\'re planning not to do more for the week), check off the "Physical activities" to-do.\n4. **Post in the Rogues\' Playground guild chat.** You can brag to the guild, give an update on your mid-week progress, post about something you wish to discuss, and/or reply to someone else\'s post. A "brag" is simply giving yourself credit, publicly, for whatever you did do this week--it\'s a good way to acknowledge your successes, no matter how small, and we strongly encourage it! You can act boastful or keep it simple; it\'s all in good roguish fun.\n\n**Note:** You can modify your checklist as needed to motivate yourself, and you do not need to complete all your goals to be eligible to win. We\'re here to improve our fitness, not to be perfect!\n\n## How to win\n1. Join this challenge--and don\'t leave it early!\n2. Post to the guild chat during the week. This makes you a contender for the prize.\n\nAll contender names are added to a list, which the challenge creator ports to a [Random Name Picker](https://www.miniwebtool.com/random-name-picker/) after the challenge is completed. The Random Name Picker chooses the winner. PAC winners are awarded every two weeks.',

      '## **The Situation**\n\nDoes this sound familiar? There\'s something you really, really want to accomplish, but every time you think about starting, you just get discouraged by the sheer enormity of it? Do you want to take a nap every time you even *think* about doing it? No worries! By breaking these big tasks and projects into smaller ones, we can get that feeling of accomplishment and over time, conquer our projects more easily.\n\n## **How Does This Challenge Work?**\n\nStart by identifying one daunting task (we\'ll call it your Focus Project). Next, spend a few minutes breaking that Focus Project down into smaller pieces; make these small enough that you can complete at least one each day! Then create a Hard To-Do representing the Focus Project, and easy To-Dos for each small task.\n\n## **Example:**\n\nIf you wanted to clean your house... you would probably divide it up into rooms and then in turn list the tasks for each room... eg. You might break it down into cleaning your desk, your laundry, your floor, and your furniture, and then further break those down into steps for each...\n\n🔹 Put away books (easy)\n\n🔹 Clear trash off of desk (easy)\n\n🔹 Put away things on desk (easy)\n\n🔹 Dust & wipe down desk (easy)\n\n🔹 Get all dirty clothes off the floor and into the wash basket (easy)\n\n🔹 Throw away all the rubbish (easy)\n\n🔹 Pick up all other items from floor (easy)\n\n🔹 Vacuum floor (easy)\n\n🔹 *Etc!*\n\n## **How Do I Win?**\n\nThis challenge ends at the end of each month and a new one will be put up for the following month! The winner will be randomly chosen from the people who have checked off "I completed my entire focus task!" and informed the COB Guild of their victory. 🍀 Good luck!\n\n### Join the ***Conquerors of Betterment*** Guild [Here!](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/51d6ffd2-7f44-4742-9626-07be10192134)',

Decide what type of food you want to eat, whether that means something drastic like going vegan or something simple like eating what you always have, but less than you used to eat.  Either way, planning your meals ahead of time and shopping for them will help you eat more consciously and help you stay within a budget.  The goal here is to have a list of menus that are easily selected and used.  Add new menus each week to your repertoire.  Expand your food "vocabulary".  And create something easy and usable for the rest of your life.  So make you plan and enjoy!  And many thanks and kudos to CloJo for allowing us to copy her Hordes Fed meal planning challenge as a 52 week challenge!',

      "*Get the most steps in the month of June!*\n\n## Overview\nUnlike most challenges in the Rogues' Playground, this challenge is a direct competition among contestants! You'll need a way to track your steps for this challenge (such as a step tracker, your phone, or a fitness watch).\n\n## How it works\n\n1. **Join the Guild.**   \nJoin [The Rogues' Playground](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02330380-adcc-4e6b-b208-127de8cc70b9) guild if you're not already a member (this is required to be eligible for the gem prize).   \n&ensp;\n2. **Add your @username.**    \nAfter you join this challenge, add your Habitica user name to the [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cii-Ve05BqFFzgjASOTukjWjI3n-4f_VeGxeNNAsyho/edit#gid=1999489959) (you do not need a Google account).   \n&ensp;\n3. **Track your steps.**   \nUse this sheet to track your number of steps for each week of the month of June (most weeks start on Monday and end on Sunday, but because June starts on a Wednesday and ends on a Thursday, the first and last weeks are short).   \n&ensp;\n4. **A little friendly competition.**   \nThis sheet means we'll have visibility of each others' progress--so that you can try to surpass your closest competitors!   \n&ensp;\n5. **Check-in.**   \nCheck-in with [The Rogues' Playground](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02330380-adcc-4e6b-b208-127de8cc70b9) at the end of the month to be eligible for the gem prize!\n\n## How to win\nThe challenge will have one grand prize winner (5 gems) and three runners-up (1 gem). To win this challenge (or to be a runner-up), you must:\n\n- Get the most (or next-most) steps over the month of June.       \n&ensp;   \n- Check-in with [The Rogues' Playground](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02330380-adcc-4e6b-b208-127de8cc70b9) at the end of the month and be a member of [The Rogues' Playground](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/02330380-adcc-4e6b-b208-127de8cc70b9).    \n&ensp;   \n- Add your steps information for the week to the spreadsheet **within 3 days of when that week ends**. Any steps added late (outside of 3 days) will be discounted from your total. Google sheets tracks when updates are made, and at the end of the month, I will be reviewing all updates to ensure that only valid steps are counted towards your final total.   \n&ensp;\n- Count your steps for at least 3 weeks over the month of June (weeks do not have to be consecutive).   \n\nThe last two rules are to prevent any last-minute cheating towards the end of the month--not that I would ever expect such a thing from our wholesome and innocent rogues ;)\n\nIf you achieve a **very high** daily step count (you are truly an inspiration) @Yoshikora may contact you and request an explanation of why your step count is so high and/or photo evidence (your photo will be anonymous and you will be given full support). This only happens on rare occasions and you're always innocent until proven guilty :heart:   \n\nThis challenge runs from *June 1* until *June 30*. The winner will be awarded on July 2.\n\n**May the spirit of friendly competition drive you to greater success!**\n\n&ensp;\n\n&ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; &ensp; :shoe:\n\n&ensp;\n",
